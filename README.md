# Countdown-Wallpaper
I made this Countdown Wallpaper to keep me motivated, focused and to constantly remind me of how slippery time really is.

The design was made in Adobe Illustrator, used After Effects to animate it and I wrote a bunch of scripts to make it work with Windows.

Image Magick is awesome. This was my first time using it, but definitely not the last.

<br/>

[**This YouTube video**](https://youtu.be/JknoggMT1Sk) walks you through the setup process: 
 - customizing the design,
 - rendering out the countdown images,
 - setting up the project files / folders,
 - setting up the scripts,
 - scheduling a daily task to change the wallpaper.


The scripts were tested and working on Windows 10 and 11.

#### A couple things to make your life easier
If you don't want to bother with After Effects,
I'm working on a version of the design that only requires Image Magick for editing.
When it's done, it's gonna be available here. Soonâ„¢

After Effects Plug-in Folder location:

> **Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects < version >\Support Files\Plug-ins**

<br/>

The commands to in PowerShell:

> Get-ExecutionPolicy
    
 
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
